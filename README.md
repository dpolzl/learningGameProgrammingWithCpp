# learningGameProgrammingWithCpp
Learning C++ through Game Programming. 

Summary
In this chapter, you should have learned the following concepts:
* Cþþ is the primary language used in AAA game programming.
* A program is a series of Cþþ statements.
* The basic lifecycle of a Cþþ program is idea, plan, source code, object file, executable.
* Programming errors tend to fall into three categories—compile errors, link errors, and run-time errors.
* A function is a group of programming statements that can do some work and return a value.
* Every program must contain a main() function, which is the starting point of the program.
* The #include directive tells the preprocessor to include another file in the current one.
* The standard library is a set of files that you can include in your program files to handle basic functions like input and output.
* iostream, which is part of the standard library, is a file that contains
code to help with standard input and output.
* The std namespace includes elements from the standard library. To access an element from the namespace, you need to prefix the element with std:: or employ using.
* cout is an object, defined in the file iostream, that’s used to send data to the standard output stream (generally the computer screen).
* cin is an object, defined in the file iostream, that’s used to get data from the standard input stream (generally the keyboard).
* Cþþ has built-in arithmetic operators, such as the familiar addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—and even the unfamiliar modulus.
* Cþþ defines fundamental types for Boolean, single-character, integer, and floating point values.
* The Cþþ standard library provides a type of object (string) for strings. n You can use typedef to create a new name for an existing type.
* A constant is a name for an unchangeable value.
* An enumeration is a sequence of unsigned int constants.
